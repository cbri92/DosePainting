# DosePainting

**Author**: Caterina Brighi

Scripts for the use of MRI data to derive heterogeneous dose prescriptions within the radiotherapy target, using patient-specific TCP data.

**Setup/Build/Install** 
To be able to use the above scipts you need to have the following python packages intalled:

```
- matplotlib
- SimpleITK
- numpy
- pandas
- datetime
- os
- glob
- gzip
- shutil
- xlsxwriter
- scipy
- dicom2nifti
- skimage
- pydicom
- platipy
```

You also need to have the *ImageAnalysisFunctions.py*, *ImageResultsVisualizationFunctions.py* and *ImageStatisticsFunctions.py* files in the same folders as the other .py files of this repo. 

**Usage** 
1. *dicom2nii.py* - this scripts convert the patients dicom files (MRI, RTSTRUCT, RTDOSE, CT) into nifti files.
2. *RegistrationCT_T2_DWI.py* - this script is used to register CT images to T2 MRI image space, and then to DWI image space, by means of a rigid registration using SimpleITK.
3. *alpha_beta_Protons.py* - this script is used to derive alpha and beta maps from maps of LET and PHYS dose, by applying the model developed in the publication [McNamara AL, Schuemann J, Paganetti H. A phenomenological relative biological effectiveness (RBE) model for proton therapy 
based on all published in vitro cell survival data. Phys Med Biol [Internet]. 2015 Nov 7;60(21):8399â€“416.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/8399)).
4. *Dpresc_fromTCP.py* - this script uses patient-specific information of tumour cellularity (derived from DWI-ADC data), alpha and beta to derive an optimal dose prescription based on a tumour control probability model (based on poissonian distribution and LQ model).
5. *CTV_doseStats.py* - this script generates an excel spreadsheet with some statistics metrics calculated on the PHYS dose maps and the optimised dose prescriptions in the clinical target volume (CTV). These metrics include: Mean, std, median, max and min dose.

**Directory Structure** 
The original data directory before converting the dicom images to nifti with the *dicom2nii.py* script should be the following:
